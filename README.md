## Nicsena Express Logger (BETA)

Nicsena Express Logger is a logger made in express that logs IP addresses, Browser User-Agent, and Requests that has been made to the server. Request Logging, IP address logging, and Browser User-Agent logging can be disabled at anytime in the server.js file under Log Mode Variables. 

Nicsena Express Logger is in BETA stage, and not yet finished. This doesn't save logs yet, and support for saving logs will be in a future update.

NIcsena Express Logger has been tested locally, not publicly. There may or will be bugs when hosting publicly.

**NOTE:** Nicsena Express Logger is getting developed by a person who doesn't have a lot of knowledge about Node and Express and EJS. The updates may probably take hours or days to do, and a lot of time of searching the web on how to do this and that.

## Requirements:

#### Node.js (You can download and install Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/ "here"))
#### Express.js
#### Body-Parser
#### EJS

##### * Use `npm install express body-parser ejs` to install the required modules for the server.

## Supported Operating Systems:

#### Windows 7 - 10 (7, 8, 8.1, and 10)
#### Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, and More)

##### Finally, my first project that is for both operating systems without creating a 2nd edition for the 2nd OS (Linux).

## Testing:

Nicsena Express Logger has been tested on Windows 10 during a development live stream.

I don't have a virtual machine that haves 8 and 8.1. I will be getting the ISOs of the windows versions, and will be going to test Nicsena Express Logger on there.
